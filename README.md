# waxpost-userscript

This is a WIP browser user-script version of Waxpost, the non-functional Weasyl crossposter. Currently works with FurAffinity, Sofurry, Inkbunny, and DeviantArt. This extension lets you easily crosspost images from these websites to Weasyl.

# Installation

You will need the Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey browser extension. That means this should work on any browser, instead of just Chrome like the original.

Click [-here-](https://github.com/warpKaiba/waxpost-userscript/raw/main/weasyl-crossposter.user.js) to install.

Select the "crosspost to Weasyl" option from the extension's toolbar menu.

It should open a new tab with most of the info filled out.
